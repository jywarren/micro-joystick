üïπÔ∏èüî¨ joysticks for microscopes

This design uses two sewing pins stuck through an inner frame, laid inside a second frame but with overlapping "wings" through which the pins pass to link the two frames. Bending the pins left and right moves the inner frame by microscopic distances in both axes. The inner frame holds a standard 75x26 millimeter microscope slide.

### Assembly

The design in joystick-frames.svg may be lasercut or printed and cut by hand onto cardstock or mat board.

1. Stack the two rectangular frames (the "moving frames" -- one with "wings" and one without) so the one with wings is on top. This allows the wings to overhang and lay on top of the larger U-shaped frame. 
2. Align the divots on the two stacked frames so you can use a fingernail to get a slide out of the frame more easily. This was really annoying in the first prototype because I had to use a knife to pull out the slides.
3. Tape the frames together with thin strong tape, like painters tape or Scotch/cellophane tape.
4. Tape over the holes on the wings so that there's a thin "membrane" to punch the needles through. This will be how the needles are fixed to the moving frame. I use painter's tape, but stiff paper could also work, as shown in the GIF above. I thought I'd have to replace this often as it loosens up around the needles, but it turns out not to be necessary. 
5. Fill the matching holes in the U-frame with something soft and springy. I used silicone, but small lumps of foam rubber can also work. Cork, maybe? Anything to embed the needle tips in but which allows them to flex back and forth. Even tiny snips or rolls of rubber band could maybe work. 
6. If using silicone, probably seal off the bottom of the U-frame holes with some tape from the bottom side, facing up, so the silicone is held in place while it dries. I did this but am not sure it's necessary.
7. Tape the U-frame to your microscope stage so slides are centered on the lens. 
8. Place the moving frames over the U-frame, and punch the needles through the tape membranes and into the silicone (or whatever you used in the holes) firmly. 

You should be done! 

If the slide isn't a snug fit, you can tape it in place.
