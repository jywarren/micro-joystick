joysticks for microscopes

This design uses two sewing pins stuck through an inner frame, laid inside a second frame but with overlapping "wings" through which the pins pass to link the two frames. Bending the pins left and right moves the inner frame by microscopic distances in both axes. The inner frame holds a standard 75x26 millimeter microscope slide.
